Team contributions (Block 2):
Laura:
- drawing the graph in the GUI (classes Vertex, Edge, Graph, GraphComponent, GraphViewer)
- adding the possibility to change the color of vertices by clicking (class VertexClickListener)
- adding the possibility to move vertices around with the mouse (class VertexMovementListener)
- collaborating with Zhiling to implement the hint function which gives an upper limit on the number of colors (hint button, class HintFunction)
- project planning
Pietro:
- further optimisation of the exact algorithm for calculating the chromatic number (class BruteForce)
- random graph generator (class GenerateGraph)
- drawing the color grid (classes ColorGrid, ColorListener), and modifying class VertexClickListener so that the color will be the one user chooses from the color grid
- third game mode (details & classes involved?)
- color legality check verifying that two adjacent nodes do not have the same color, and displaying a "you lost" message if they do
- hint function (details & classes involved?)
Tijn:
- made a continuously updating gameclass and the GUI
- game modes 1 and 2 (details & classes involved?)
- FileChooser (enabling the user to choose an existing graph from a file)
- integration of all classes into a functioning game
Lena:
- game start screen (welcome screen), with the game mode & difficulty choices
- presentation
- team meeting minutes
Zhiling:
- timer classes to be used in the different game modes
- collaborating with Laura to implement the hint function which gives an upper limit on the number of colors (hint button, class HintFunction)
Eros:
- results screen
- random graph generator (with Pietro)
- presentation
- team meeting minutes
